# What is RetroDECK Cooker?
RetroDECK Cooker are the bleeding edge development builds of [RetroDECK](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK). These builds are only for development and testing purposes.

## ðŸ›‘ Warning! Backup before testing! ðŸ›‘
These builds can make you loose all data including `ROMS`, `BIOS` and `Scraped Data` etc..
We recomend that you don't run Cooker builds on your main gaming machine and wait for Stable Releases. 

## ðŸ›‘ Warning! Expect bugs and issues! ðŸ›‘
These builds can contain several bug and should be seen as unstable. 

# Can I help you with testing? 
Yes, do the backups above and tell in Discord channel `i-want-to-help` that you are interested in testing out Cooker builds.
You will get some instructions from one of the mods and be promoted to a `BetaTester` role.
